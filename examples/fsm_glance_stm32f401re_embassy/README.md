# LSM6DSV80X Glance and Deglance Gesture Detection on STM32F401RE Nucleo-64

This example demonstrates how to detect *glance* and *deglance* gestures using the **LSM6DSV80X** inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor on an **STM32F401RE** Nucleo-64 board. The sensor's finite state machine (FSM) is configured via a JSON-generated register sequence to recognize these gestures, and detected events are output over UART.

The program uses the Embassy STM32 HAL for peripheral initialization and interrupt handling, and the `lsm6dsv80x` Rust driver crate for sensor communication. The sensor FSM configuration is embedded as Rust code generated from a JSON file, enabling flexible and maintainable sensor programming.

## Hardware Setup

- **Microcontroller Board:** STM32F401RE Nucleo-64
- **Sensor:** LSM6DSV80X IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope + FSM-based gesture detection)
- **Communication Interface:** I2C1 at 100 kHz (PB8 = SCL, PB9 = SDA)
- **UART:** USART2 (PA2 TX) at 115200 baud for serial output
- **Interrupt Pin:** PC0 configured as input with external interrupt for FSM event notification

### Default Pin Configuration

| Signal       | STM32F401RE Pin | Description                      |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| I2C1_SCL     | PB8             | I2C clock line (open-drain)     |
| I2C1_SDA     | PB9             | I2C data line (open-drain)      |
| USART2_TX    | PA2             | UART transmit for debug output  |
| EXTI0 (INT)  | PC0             | External interrupt from sensor FSM event |

The LSM6DSV80X sensor is connected via I2C1 on PB8/PB9. The FSM event interrupt line is connected to PC0, configured to trigger an external interrupt on rising edge. UART output is routed through PA2 for serial communication.

## Code Description

### Initialization

- The program initializes microcontroller peripherals including clocks, GPIO pins, I2C, and UART.
- I2C1 is configured at 100 kHz Standard Mode on pins PB8 (SCL) and PB9 (SDA).
- UART is configured on USART2 (PA2) at 115200 baud, 8 data bits, no parity.
- PC0 is configured as an input pin with no pull resistor and set up as an external interrupt line (EXTI0).
- A delay abstraction is created for timing operations.

### Sensor Setup via JSON Configuration

- The LSM6DSV80X sensor is initialized over I2C with the low I2C address.
- The device ID is read and verified; if mismatched, an error message is sent over UART and the program halts.
- The sensor is reset to default configuration and the program waits until reset completes.
- The sensor is configured by applying a sequence of register writes and delays defined in the `lsm6dsv80x_glance_detection.ucf` array, which is generated from a JSON file. This programs the sensor's FSM to detect glance and deglance gestures.

### Main Loop

- The program waits for a rising edge interrupt on PC0, indicating an FSM event.
- Upon interrupt, it reads the sensor's event status registers.
- If FSM1 event is detected, it reads the FSM output and matches the event code:
  - `0x08` → "Glance event"
  - `0x20` → "Deglance event"
- The detected event is printed over UART.

## Usage

1. Connect the LSM6DSV80X sensor to the STM32F401RE Nucleo board via I2C1 (PB8/PB9).
2. Connect the sensor's FSM interrupt output to PC0 on the STM32F401RE.
3. Build and flash the firmware onto the STM32F401RE board.
4. Open a serial terminal at 115200 baud on the USART2 TX line.
5. Perform glance and deglance gestures with the sensor.
6. Observe event messages printed on the serial terminal.

## Notes

- The sensor FSM configuration is applied via a JSON-generated register sequence (`GLANCE`), enabling flexible FSM programming.
- UART output uses blocking writes without DMA.
- The example runs entirely within the Embassy async main task.
- The environment is `#![no_std]` and `#![no_main]` for embedded Rust.
- Panic behavior is set to halt on panic using `defmt` and `panic_probe`.
